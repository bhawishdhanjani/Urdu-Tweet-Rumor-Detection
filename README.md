# FACTS MATTER: ML-BASED RUMOR DETECTION IN TWEETS WRITTEN IN URDU LANGUAGE

## Project Overview
This project is designed to detect rumors in tweets written in Urdu language using Machine Learning techniques. The system is divided into two main components:

1. **FactChecker** - The frontend interface for users.
2. **Rumor_Detection** - The backend ML model for rumor detection.

---

## Prerequisites

### General Requirements:
- **Node.js** and **npm** should be pre-installed for the frontend.
- **Python** (version 3.7 or above) and **pip** should be pre-installed for the backend.

## Setting Up the Project

### 1. FactChecker (Frontend)

The `FactChecker` folder contains the frontend code. To set up and run the frontend:

1. Navigate to the `FactChecker` folder:
    ```bash
    cd FactChecker
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the frontend server (optional, depending on your project setup):
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### 2. Rumor_Detection (Backend)

The `Rumor_Detection` folder contains the code for the ML model. To set up and run the backend:

1. Navigate to the `Rumor_Detection` folder:
    ```bash
    cd Rumor_Detection
    ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the backend server:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Running the Project

1. Ensure both the frontend and backend components are set up.
2. Start the frontend server from the `FactChecker` folder.
3. Start the backend by running `main.py` from the `Rumor_Detection` folder.
4. Access the frontend interface through your web browser to interact with the system.
